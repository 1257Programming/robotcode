USBCamera
=========
This is the result of my tating a class for getting images from the USB camera. It's not complete yet but it works at this stage.
<br>
USBCamera1257.h and USBCamera1257.cpp contain the actual class declaration/definition, and Robot.cpp is a somewhat-complete example implementation.
<br>
I tested this on TestBot and it worked (10/26/15@4:45PM)
